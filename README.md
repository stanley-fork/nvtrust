# nvTrust: Ancillary Software for NVIDIA Trusted Computing Solutions

This repository provides essential resources for implementing and validating Trusted Computing Solutions on NVIDIA hardware. It focuses on attestation, a crucial aspect of ensuring the integrity and security of confidential computing environments.

## Tools and Components

This repository includes the following attestation tools and utilities:

### Guest Tools

- **[Attestation SDK (Python)](guest_tools/attestation_sdk/README.md)** - A comprehensive Python SDK providing easy-to-use APIs for implementing GPU and NVSwitch attestation capabilities into your applications. Supports both local and remote attestation workflows.

- **[Local GPU Verifier](guest_tools/gpu_verifiers/local_gpu_verifier/README.md)** - A standalone tool for local GPU attestation verification. *Note: This tool is now integrated into the Attestation SDK. Please use the Attestation SDK for GPU attestation workflows.*

- **[PPCIE Verifier](guest_tools/ppcie-verifier/README.md)** - Protected PCIe verifier for multi-GPU confidential computing setups where all GPUs are in PPCIE mode, enabling plain-text NVLink traffic while preserving confidential VM security.

### Host Tools

- **[Host Tools](host_tools/README.md)** - Utilities for configuring GPU Confidential Computing modes and sample KVM scripts for launching Confidential VMs from the host.
